      <span class="mono-font">Portable Executable CLR Viewer</span> is a hex viewer for
      <span class="mono-font">.NET</span> binaries. It also supports native binaries but highlights fields mainly related to the
      <span class="mono-font">CLR</span>.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>File offset</em>: expressed in hexadecimal. The bytes are displayed from left to right and top to bottom. The first
          column represents the 7 most significant digits while the first row represents the least significant digit. The
          cell on the third row (<span class="mono-font">00000020</span>)
          and last column (<span class="mono-font">0F</span>) has a file offset of
          <span class="mono-font">0000002F</span>.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Little-endian</em>: Windows is a
          <app-link [href]="'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness'">little-endian</app-link> system. This means than the least significant bytes will appear before the most significant
          ones. So if you were to find the following value:
          <span class="mono-font">E0 93 01 00</span>, the address would be
          <span class="mono-font">00 01 93 E0</span> - only the byte order is inverted, not the order within a byte - which would commonly be written
          as
          <span class="mono-font">0x193E0</span> (<span class="mono-font">0x</span> denotes a hex notation and the leading 0s are dropped as they are not significant).</li>
        <li>
          <em>Relative Virtual Address (RVA)</em>: the address of an item after it is loaded into memory, with the base address
          of the image file subtracted from it.</li>
      </ul>
